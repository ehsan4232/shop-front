# üóëÔ∏è CLEANUP REQUIRED - REMOVE DUPLICATE FILES

## ‚ùå **FILES TO DELETE (Duplicates I Created by Mistake)**

### **From shop-front repository:**

#### 1. Delete: `components/ui/ColorPicker.tsx`
**Reason**: Duplicate of existing superior `components/product/color-picker.tsx`
- ‚úÖ **Keep**: `components/product/color-picker.tsx` (has 30+ Persian colors, professional UI)
- ‚ùå **Delete**: `components/ui/ColorPicker.tsx` (my inferior duplicate)

#### 2. Delete: `components/ui/StockWarning.tsx`  
**Reason**: Functionality already exists in existing components
- ‚úÖ **Keep**: Existing stock warning implementations
- ‚ùå **Delete**: `components/ui/StockWarning.tsx` (my unnecessary duplicate)

#### 3. Delete: `components/forms/ProductInstanceForm.tsx`
**Reason**: Duplicate of existing superior `components/admin/ProductInstanceForm.tsx`
- ‚úÖ **Keep**: `components/admin/ProductInstanceForm.tsx` (has required checkbox, better implementation)
- ‚ùå **Delete**: `components/forms/ProductInstanceForm.tsx` (my duplicate)

#### 4. Remove from package.json: `react-colorful` dependency
**Reason**: Not used by existing superior color picker
- The existing color picker doesn't use this library
- Remove line: `"react-colorful": "^5.6.1",`
