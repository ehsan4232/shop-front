// This file has been deprecated and removed to eliminate duplicate API clients.
// Please use /lib/api.ts instead, which provides comprehensive API coverage.
// 
// The consolidated api.ts file includes:
// ✅ Complete REST API wrapper
// ✅ All CRUD operations  
// ✅ File upload support
// ✅ Authentication integration
// ✅ Enhanced endpoints for new backend features
//
// This change eliminates confusion and ensures single source of truth for API calls.
